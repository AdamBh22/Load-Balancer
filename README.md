# Load Balancer Simulation

This project simulates a Load Balancer system designed to manage the distribution of tasks across multiple cores in a multicore system. The load balancing mechanism is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

## Features

- **Task Distribution**: Simulates the allocation and distribution of tasks to different cores in a multicore system.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project uses OOP to organize and manage different system components.
- **Unit Testing**: Integrated with GoogleTest for comprehensive unit testing to ensure functionality and reliability.
- **CMake Build System**: Utilizes CMake for project configuration and build management.

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- **CMake**: The project uses CMake for build configuration.
- **GoogleTest**: Used for unit testing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamBh22/Load-Balancer.git
   cd Load-Balancer
